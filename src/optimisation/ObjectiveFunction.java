/**
 * Represents the objective function for the optimisation of the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon.
 * 
 * Evaluates two conflicting objectives:
 * 1. Maximise annual energy output (MWh/year)
 * 2. Minimise unit cost of energy (GBP/MWh)
 * 
 * The unit cost is calculated as total capital cost divided by the annual energy output,
 * creating a natural trade-off where strategies that generate more energy have lower unit costs,
 * but may require complex operational strategies.
 * 
 * Based on Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon parameters from published literature and project proposal.
