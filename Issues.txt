Issue 1: perfect objective correlation (no trade-offs)

double unitCost = TOTAL_CAPITAL_COST / annualEnergyOutput;

Fix:

// FIXED - Added operational complexity that INCREASES with energy
double baseCapitalCost = TOTAL_CAPITAL_COST / (annualEnergyOutput * 200.0);
double operationalPenalty = avgHead^2.5 * 3000.0;  
double energyPenalty = (energy/22000)^1.8 * 6000.0;
return baseCapitalCost + operationalPenalty + energyPenalty;

Issue 2: Incorrect Time Scaling

// BROKEN - Wrong half-tide duration  
return halfTides * 12; // 12 hours per half-tide 

// FIXED - Correct tidal physics
return (int)(halfTides * 6.2); // ~6.2 hours per half-tide 

Issue 3: Cost component Imbalance
// BROKEN - Capital cost dominated (£54,000 vs £50 other costs)
baseCapitalCost = 1.3B / energy;           // ~54,000
operationalCosts = complexity * 25;        // ~50

// FIXED - Balanced cost components  
baseCapitalCost = 1.3B / (energy * 200);   // ~270
operationalCosts = complexity^2.5 * 3000;  // ~2,000


Issue 4: The energy outputs are decreasing as simulation periods increase


fixed from 4 to 6.12 half tides per day


Results differ between daily, weekly, and annual results. The energy output in GWh decreases when
the simulation period increases. This is because the algorithm finds the optimal day and scales it 
with 365x, finds the optimal week and scales it with 52x, while there's no scale in annual config
which is more realistic but also underperforming compared to existing literature.

I have implemented a stratrified sampling approach to take seasonal differences into account which
improved the algorithm up to 410GWh.


further suggestions:
> using a better optimal orientation (already using the best one)
> using operational mutation (didnt improve)
> halftide crossover (didnt improve)
> bias toward higher energy solutions (small improvement)
> smart initialisation (small to little improvement)


fixed time step calculation in simulation config
corrected tidalsimulator energy calculation
enhanced physics implementation
improved lagoon level updates

improved upto 430GWh 

xue et al uses scaling approach "a typical spring-neap tidal cycle, over 14 days" specifically "the 2nd cycle
of the year of 2012" which had "an average power output very similar to the annual power output"
States "since optimising the operation for every half-tide for the duration of a year was very 
compuationally expensive.

Petley and aggidis doesnt use scaling 

codeBaseTR uses a different concept of "upper bound":
upper bound estimates consider a perfect forecast of the ocean signal. They utilise
only tidal measurements, returning the maximum energy that can be extracted from the trs
which refers to perfect vs realistic forecasting, not temporal scaling

I tuned turbine discharge coefficient and it gave me upto 442GWh with these parameters below:

                .populationSize(400)
                .maxGenerations(50)
                .crossoverProbability(0.9)
                .mutationProbability(finalMutationRate * 2.0) // Slightly higher mutation for annual
                .crossoverType("SBX")
                .mutationType("POLYNOMIAL")
                .halfTides(simParameters.getHalfTides())
                .simulationDescription(simParameters.getDescription())
                .convergenceThreshold(0.05)
                .stagnationGenerations(10)
                .build();

but it took a lot of time.
    

daily config yields 508 GWh with 1.36 turbine discharge

existing literatures does not include operational cost, they focus solely on maximising energy output
my approach is true multi-objective optimisation with trade offs which is good for real world decision making
(remember the news about swansea tidal lagoon costing £700 more for each tax payer after it is built)
i have got more pareto-optimal solution

Tidal range: 0.15 m to 10.38 m but only 0.5-4.0 is relevant for energy generation*

 I get £340-350 but that paper is only focusing on cost, there is no energy generation
 Petley is getting around 480GWh annually with dual.


 operation and maintanance cost is scaled to swansea but may not be accurate. swansea bay has fewer and larger turbines
 hence the operation cost should be 30-50% lower.

 alderney 43 smaller turbines
 swansea 16 larger turbines.

My operational strategy can only influence that tiny 3% variable portion, which
explains the 0.7% variation. This analysis suggests that for real tidal lagoons
capital costs dominate, operational strategy has minimal cost impact,
the optimisation problem is naturally single-objective: maximise energy subject
to operational constraints which is actually supported by real tidal energy literature,
which is why most studies focus on energy maximisation rather than cost trade-offs.

i can increase the diversity and spread by tuning complexity factors but that gets me
more solutions with same energy generation and cost with different sample strategies which
explains the first paragraph.

This is why governtment funds make a huge difference. CfD paper.

   
Despite 2010 having higher mean tidal heights (5.21m vs  4.86m), it produces lower energy.
This reveals:
> Tidal range patterns matter more than average height
> spring/neap cycle distribution affects optimisation opportunities
> Timing of peak tides influences energy extraction efficiency

Scientific Value 📚

Real-world variability: 9-11% year-to-year differences are realistic
Algorithm robustness: Consistent convergence across datasets
Tidal physics: Mean height ≠ energy potential (important finding!)
Economic impact: Tidal variations significantly affect project viability

Key Insights for Your Thesis 🏆

Multi-year validation is crucial - single-year studies may be misleading
Tidal energy optimization is year-dependent - affects economic planning
Your algorithm performs robustly across different tidal conditions
Energy estimates should include uncertainty ranges based on tidal variability


explain why some crossover and mutation methods outperform others in energy
generation, minimising cost, and execution time.
