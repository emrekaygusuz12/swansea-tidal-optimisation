Issue 1: perfect objective correlation (no trade-offs)

double unitCost = TOTAL_CAPITAL_COST / annualEnergyOutput;

Fix:

// FIXED - Added operational complexity that INCREASES with energy
double baseCapitalCost = TOTAL_CAPITAL_COST / (annualEnergyOutput * 200.0);
double operationalPenalty = avgHead^2.5 * 3000.0;  
double energyPenalty = (energy/22000)^1.8 * 6000.0;
return baseCapitalCost + operationalPenalty + energyPenalty;

Issue 2: Incorrect Time Scaling

// BROKEN - Wrong half-tide duration  
return halfTides * 12; // 12 hours per half-tide 

// FIXED - Correct tidal physics
return (int)(halfTides * 6.2); // ~6.2 hours per half-tide 

Issue 3: Cost component Imbalance
// BROKEN - Capital cost dominated (£54,000 vs £50 other costs)
baseCapitalCost = 1.3B / energy;           // ~54,000
operationalCosts = complexity * 25;        // ~50

// FIXED - Balanced cost components  
baseCapitalCost = 1.3B / (energy * 200);   // ~270
operationalCosts = complexity^2.5 * 3000;  // ~2,000


Issue 4: The energy outputs are decreasing as simulation periods increase


fixed from 4 to 6.12 half tides per day


Results differ between daily, weekly, and annual results. The energy output in GWh decreases when
the simulation period increases. This is because the algorithm finds the optimal day and scales it 
with 365x, finds the optimal week and scales it with 52x, while there's no scale in annual config
which is more realistic but also underperforming compared to existing literature.

I have implemented a stratrified sampling approach to take seasonal differences into account which
improved the algorithm up to 410GWh.


further suggestions:
> using a better optimal orientation (already using the best one)
> using operational mutation (didnt improve)
> halftide crossover (didnt improve)
> bias toward higher energy solutions (small improvement)
> smart initialisation (small to little improvement)


fixed time step calculation in simulation config
corrected tidalsimulator energy calculation
enhanced physics implementation
improved lagoon level updates

improved upto 430GWh 

xue et al uses scaling approach "a typical spring-neap tidal cycle, over 14 days" specifically "the 2nd cycle
of the year of 2012" which had "an average power output very similar to the annual power output"
States "since optimising the operation for every half-tide for the duration of a year was very 
compuationally expensive.

Petley and aggidis doesnt use scaling 

codeBaseTR uses a different concept of "upper bound":
upper bound estimates consider a perfect forecast of the ocean signal. They utilise
only tidal measurements, returning the maximum energy that can be extracted from the trs
which refers to perfect vs realistic forecasting, not temporal scaling

I tuned turbine discharge coefficient and it gave me upto 442GWh with these parameters below:

                .populationSize(400)
                .maxGenerations(50)
                .crossoverProbability(0.9)
                .mutationProbability(finalMutationRate * 2.0) // Slightly higher mutation for annual
                .crossoverType("SBX")
                .mutationType("POLYNOMIAL")
                .halfTides(simParameters.getHalfTides())
                .simulationDescription(simParameters.getDescription())
                .convergenceThreshold(0.05)
                .stagnationGenerations(10)
                .build();

but it took a lot of time.
    

daily config yields 508 GWh with 1.36 turbine discharge

existing literatures does not include operational cost, they focus solely on maximising energy output
my approach is true multi-objective optimisation with trade offs which is good for real world decision making
(remember the news about swansea tidal lagoon costing £700 more for each tax payer after it is built)
i have got more pareto-optimal solution

Tidal range: 0.15 m to 10.38 m but only 0.5-4.0 is relevant for energy generation*
